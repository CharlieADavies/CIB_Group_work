# Project Herbie
For our Computing in Business week at Bournemouth university, we are tasked with developing a parking registration system that allows users to book parking for their workplace on specific days, except on days where they are instructed to use the local Park & Ride facilities. This is our implementation, which we've named after the 1969 movie The Love Bug's car: Herbie.
